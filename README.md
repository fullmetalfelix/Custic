# Custic

This code does MD simulation of AFM tip on a surface entirely on GPU. It is one of the first MD codes in CUDA, developed long ago (2010-2011).
The source is poorly commented, messy and difficult to read. It has also been tweaked and reoptimised to do very specific simulations, over the years.
This is in no way a good, generally applicable code. It does one thing, but very fast, and I am not sure now what that thing was any longer.
Yet this code gave me data for 3 publications!

For CUDA pros only.
